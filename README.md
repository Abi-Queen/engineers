![screenshot of app](ss.jpg)

## Description
This project is a Node.js application that uses a command-line interface to accept user input and then utilize that input to generate an HTML page. When a user starts the command-line application, they are prompted to enter information about their team members. When they have entered the information, a formatted HTML page displaying the team members' information is generated. The application uses Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven Development (with Jest). 

## Video demo
